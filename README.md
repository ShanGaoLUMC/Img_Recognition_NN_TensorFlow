# Recognition of sign-representing-digit (between 0 and 5) using Neural Network in TensorFlow
This script is a **self-summarizing** version for completing the sign-representing-digit photo recognition project of Andrew Ngâ€™s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. This script has been tested and it works well on my local machine. In order to do so, I downloaded the necessary project files from the course kernel, and installed the Anaconda Python 3.6. Tensorflow is installed under Anaconda virtual environment with Python set to version 3.5 . I used pip to install other python libraries in the same virtual environment. 

### Skills to develop:
* Building a neural network in tensorflow, which needs the following steps:
  * Create a computation graph containing Tensors (Variables, Placeholders ...) and Operations (tf.matmul, tf.add, ...)
  * Create a session.
  * Initialize the session.
  * Run the session to execute the graph.
